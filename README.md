This repo contains an R Shiny app and other supplementary files.

The app shows and compares development indicators across continents and countries.
It has three different plots:

- Plot 1: Compares aggregate indicator value of all the continents for a period of 15 years
- Plot 2: Compares countries' performace on a specific development indicator
- Plot 3: Helps understand correlation (if any) between two indicators of a country

The app also shows a data table that can also be downloaded.

The dataset for this assignment was taken from the World Bank's website.

Thank you!
